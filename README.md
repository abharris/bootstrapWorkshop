# When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?

## I think if I was making a personal website or something where the product wasn’t the tech itself, I’d use bootstrap because it’s pretty, effective and fast. I think if the product itself was the website, I would want to customize it more and make it a unique product. Since Bootstrap is sort of recognizable, I feel like as a tech product it could seem like a little bit of a shortcut.

# What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?
## I think one of the downsides like they explained in their presentation is the fact that websites can look similar if they’re made with Bootstrap. If you’re making a tech product, you want it to be unique. You’d also definitely want full customization, which Bootstrap may not be able to provide. Also as we talked about it can be sort of slow and an overload of classes/feautres one might not need.
